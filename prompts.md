- I'm trying to write a web service to keep track my daily events (what did I eat with who, what did I do with who at where, etc.) I will be using postgresql db as the data store, and I have already designed db schema as in init.sql. Take a look at the schema and try to understand very well what everything means. Now I want to write a the web service on top of this fixed postgresql db schema, and I want to use Actix Web framework based on rust. Please start by setting up the actix web project skeleton, and we will continue from there.
